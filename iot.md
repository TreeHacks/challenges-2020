## :muscle: Inspiration :collision:
IoT is core to the incredible progress and advancement of technologies that we see and experience everyday. As internet-connected devices are becoming more prevalent and integrated in society, it's increasingly important to find ways to enable users to effectively communicate with others while ensuring security and privacy when transferring data. The technology world is being reshaped by the power of IoT, and it's of critical importance to direct this growth in a way that protects and improves human-to-computer interaction.
## :star: Description :sunglasses:
We're looking for skilled hackers who love electrical engineering and want to make the world better connected through networks of interrelated computing devices. The world has 4.5 billion people connected to the internet - but data tells us there are still 700+ billion unconnected things in our society. Maybe you want to address this by creating IoT satellite devices that can provide more insights and send communications into areas of the world that are less known of ([Stanford & NASA, Tiny IoT Satellites](https://theiotmagazine.com/stanford-and-nasa-launch-tiny-iot-satellites-into-earths-orbit-9e5f92487500)). Or, perhaps you wish to enrich the security and privacy in people's lives by developing innovative home-security technologies that can help monitor activity in the house ([Nest](https://nest.com)). In any direction you choose to pursue, the IoT challenge encourages hackers to connect devices in novel ways, collect interesting data, and utilize our vast network of things to make the world a better place.
