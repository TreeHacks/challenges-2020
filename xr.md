## :muscle: Inspiration :boom:

AR/VR is a fascinating problem space in that it's probably one of the most divisive among emerging technologies. Believers say it has the capacity to revolutionize, while skeptics think that it's a fad that will pass over in no time. At TreeHacks, we want you to decide for yourself where you stand, and a great way to do that is by getting your hands wet in an AR/VR project at TreeHacks. We hope that you'll explore how AR/VR can be used to take users on a journey and create empathy and experience.

## :star: Description :sunglasses:

We're looking for creative, innovative ways to apply AR/VR technology to improve users better perceiving the environment around us, or a completely new environment altogether. Perhaps you'll explore built-in AR/VR mobile packages like [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit) by Apple or [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar) by Google. Alternatively, perhaps you'll take a deep dive into using [Unity](https://unity.com/) to build more immersive applications or [Vuforia](https://developer.vuforia.com/), a major AR development platform. Either way, we hope that you'll push the boundaries of what has been done with AR/VR technology. VR Enthusiasts envision a virtual world indistinguishable from our own, with haptic devices to take interaction to the next level and AR enthusiasts have their eyes set on the AR Cloud - a real-time 3D (or spatial) map of the world, overlayed onto the real world.
