## :muscle: Inspiration :boom:

AR/VR is a fascinating problem space in that it's probably one of the most divisive among emerging technologies. Believers say it has the capacity to revolutionize, while skeptics think that it's a fad that will pass over in no time. At TreeHacks, we want you to decide for yourself where you stand, and a great way to do that is by getting your hands wet in an AR/VR project at TreeHacks. We hope that you'll explore how AR/VR can be used to take users on a journey and create empathy and experience.

## :star: Description :sunglasses:

We're looking for creative, innovative ways to apply AR/VR technology to improve users better perceiving the environment around us, or a completely new environment altogether. Perhaps you'll explore built-in AR/VR mobile packages like [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit) by Apple or [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar) by Google. Alternatively, perhaps you'll take a deep dive into using [Unity](https://unity.com/) to build more immersive applications or [Vuforia](https://developer.vuforia.com/), a major AR development platform. AR/VR has unparalleled opportunities in understanding - check out how the Wall Street Journal created a VR guided tour experience of the Nasdaq called "Is the Nasdaq in Another Bubble?" In a similar vein, AR/VR applications for experience could be incredibly useful for efficiency, equitability, and improved performance - that's exactly the goal of [STRIVR Labs](https://www.strivr.com/), developing the next generation of immersive training. Lastly, the holy grail of AR is persistence, which is being able to place an object in the world for anyone else to see, creating a whole new universe right in front of our eyes. [6D AI](https://www.6d.ai/) is a company leading in the space with the vision to build an integratable 3d map of the world. VR enthusiasts envision a virtual world indistinguishable from our own, with haptic devices to take interaction to the next level and AR enthusiasts have their eyes set on the AR Cloud - a real-time 3D (or spatial) map of the world, overlayed onto the real world.

## :heart_eyes: Events at TreeHacks :evergreen_tree:

<!--- Order by time --->
1. __Developing AR/VR Office Hours__ with developers from [Magic Leap](https://www.magicleap.com/)
    * Friday 2/14, 10pm - 11pm, in AR/VR Lab by Huang 218/219
2. __Introducing StereoKit – Next-Gen MR Dev Tools__ with [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/)
    * Friday 2/14, 10:40pm - 11:20pm, in Huang 018
    * StereoKit is an open source, cross-platform Mixed Reality library that makes MR development simple! Optimized for mobile MR hardware, and streamlined for non-game MR development, StereoKit provides important functionality that a game engine cannot.
2. __Creating Digital Holograms with Hedron Vision__ by Sam Redmond, Founder of [Hedron Vision](https://hedronvision.com/) & founder of TreeHacks :palm_tree:
    * Saturday 2/15, 1:30am - 2am, Huang 305
    * Hedron Vision helps you bring a 3D experience to 2D screens without extra hardware. With our technology, your phone screen transforms into a quasi-holographic display so that your 3D digital scenes appear to have perceptual depth. Our development tools integrate with Unity for mobile apps. In this workshop, you’ll learn how to integrate your TreeHacks 2020 project with Hedron’s technology to make your Unity applications appear holographic on phone displays, all with just a drag-and-drop plugin!
3. __Building Blocks of Unity: Learn Basics for Any AR/VR Project__ with Arjun and Joseph from [Stanford XR Club](https://www.stanfordxr.org/)
