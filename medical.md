## :muscle: Inspiration :boom:
Due to barriers ranging from high costs to lack of coverage, remote physical location to insufficient healthcare infrastructure, medical access continues to be one of the greatest problems that continually affect millions of individuals across the world. Health tech represents one of the most innovative and impactful interdisciplinary applications of technology. Adapted from our previous vertical of Healthcare, Medical Access as a challenge embodies our hope to inspire focused project developing on broadening the gateway to a basic human right. 
## :star: Description :sunglasses:
We're looking for creative, innovative ways to improve access of any form to the medical care of both physical and/or mental health across individuals and communities. Perhaps you will focus on developing solutions using drone technology to deliver medical supplies to remote locations in the world like [Zipline](https://flyzipline.com/). Maybe you will examine ways to inspire greater ownership and leverage of information regarding your medical history, like [Embleema](https://www.embleema.com/), which created a blockchain network for patients to access and share their medical records. You might think about how to expedite the process of registering at a new hospital, like [One Medical](https://www.onemedical.com/about-us/), a company that unified hospitals across the country under one platform.  You may even hope to reinvent healthcare coverage plans to better serve underprivileged communities and those without health insurance, or redesign common laboratory tests and diagnostics procedures to take place from the comfort of one's home. Regardless, we know that you will develop solutions to critical challenges in medical access and beyond to make future generations healthier and happier.
