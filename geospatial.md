## :muscle: Inspiration :boom:
Every second, we collect terabytes of traffic, satellite, and location data from devices all across the world. As this treasure trove of data continues to grow, we believe that it has the ability to inform, educate, and assist the public to make everyday lives easier and safer. To this end, we're looking for hacks utilizing these rich datasets and APIs to better understand the world we live in.


## :star: Description :sunglasses:
We’re looking for creative and novel ways to use geospatial data and resources to tackle large-scale problems and challenges facing society. Perhaps you’ll better communicate and identify regions affected by climate change with new visualizations and insights with [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/). Maybe you’ll take on traffic and congestion, looking for better ways to route people and critical supplies in times of need using APIs from [MapmyIndia](https://www.mapmyindia.com/). We’re looking for people to take these and many other rich data streams we’ve provided to help find new insights and solutions. The world is changing with data, and geospatial information has the possibility to transform how we view almost everything about the world we live in. Equipped with these resources, we know you will be able to take on these challenges.
