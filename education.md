## :muscle: Inspiration :boom:

Education technology (EdTech) is one of the most important ways of improving society. There are currently over 50 million students in elementary and secondary schools in the United States. EdTech has democratized the entire process of receiving a formal education, serving a larger and more diverse population. As the digital revolution begins to affect younger and younger students, education must adapt to students' varying learning styles. Structured lifelong learning is becoming much more common with the rise in online education platforms such as Coursera and Udemy. There are still many other areas within education that are ripe for innovation and huge growth in the coming year. 

## :star: Description :sunglasses:

**We are looking for projects that use technology to democratize access to information and make knowledge accessible across border and different learning styles.** A project could take after a similar problem as [MegaCampus](https://www.megacampus.com/?lang_ui=en) is tackling in shifting the focus of education to the current and future needs of the labor market by allowing a student to get a profession in dmeand in the labor market in 6-12 months online. Or, instead use an AI chatbot to provide free college guidance to students and help colleges recruit students at scale ([AdmitHub](https://www.admithub.com)). Even if you choose to work on something completely different, it will still make an incredible difference in the education system and improve students' ability to learn and for everyone to become lifelong learners.
