## :muscle: Inspiration :boom:

As the voice assistance craze began with the development of Siri, and then Alexa and Google, voice assistance has increasingly entered and permeated the common household. As a result, users are now more cautious about how their voice assistance products listen to them, perhaps a bit too carefully. As this area of technology progresses, we expect privacy and awareness to be of increased concern to the users. We believe that a privacy-centric voice assistance technology can be used to not just make some people's lives more convenient, but rather because the need and demand is there.

## :star: Description :sunglasses:

We're looking for creative, innovative ways to apply voice assistance to improve the accessibility and ease of life of individuals. Perhaps you'll use [Almond](https://almond.stanford.edu/), a privacy-centric virtual assistant built right here at Stanford. Or, perhaps you'll look at how voice can be used to make hands-on processes safer, like [Chris](https://chris.com/), a voice assistant specifically designed for drivers. Alternatively, perhaps you're thinking about how voice technology can be made more accessible for people with speech-difficulties or who are hard of hearing. Or, perhaps you're thinking about how voice assistance can aid people in learning a new language, or how voice assistance is only offered in a small number of languages across the globe. Regardless, we know that you will develop solutions to critical challenges in the voice assistance space, either by applying the technology in a unique way or tackling problems with the technology itself.

#### Mentors:
* SoundHound (_technical_) - reachable at their booth + Slack
* Stanford OVAL (_technical_) - reachable through Office Hours event + Slack
* Samsung (_technical_) - reachable through Slack

#### Topics:
* Accessibility
  * This term is thrown around a lot, but there is still so much work to be done, both in terms of utilizing voice assistance to make certain tasks for accessible for some, as well as making voice assistance more accessible to others. This certainly applies for people living with disabilities, but also in situations where access may not be possible, like emergency situations.
* Privacy
  * We often think about the privacy risks around voice assistants, whether it's through the data the technology collects or if someone else can hear what the user is saying to the assistant. However, voice assistants can certainly be used to enhance personal privacy. How so?
* User Experience
  * How can voice assistance improve efficiency and improve the user experience for processes that have traditionally relied on real-time person availability?
* Thinking of another use case not listed here? Awesome, feel free to go for it! Chat with voice assistance-specific mentors if you have any questions!
